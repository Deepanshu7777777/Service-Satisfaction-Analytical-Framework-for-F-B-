The project is titled "Service Satisfaction Analytical Framework for Food and Beverage (F&B) Service in United Airlines." The goal of this project is to enhance the service satisfaction rate of the Food and Beverage (F&B) offerings provided by United Airlines. The project aims to achieve this goal by identifying customer pain points and optimizing inventory planning for F&B services.

The project employs an analytical framework that involves various steps and methodologies to analyze and improve F&B service satisfaction. The description of the project includes the following key components:

Goal: The primary objective is to improve the F&B service satisfaction rate for United Airlines by identifying customer pain points and optimizing inventory planning.

Analytical Framework - Data Preprocessing: This section outlines the steps involved in preparing the data for analysis.

Data Integration: Data from multiple tables is combined using SQL queries or Pandas DataFrames in Python.
Data Cleaning: Missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data are identified and treated.
Data Transformation: Data is normalized, scaled, feature vectors are created, and categorical variables are encoded.
Analytical Framework - Descriptive Analysis: This section explains the descriptive analysis steps conducted on the data.

Univariate Analysis: Measures of central tendency and dispersion summarize individual variables.
Bivariate Analysis: Relationships between variables are examined using correlation matrices, scatter plots, etc.
Multivariate Analysis: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used for dimensionality reduction.
Analytical Framework - Inferential and Predictive Modelling: This section focuses on inferential and predictive analysis techniques.

Hypothesis Testing: Statistical tests are used to evaluate the significance of observed patterns.
Confidence Intervals: Uncertainty associated with sample statistics is estimated.
Model Training and Evaluation: Ensemble methods, Bayesian models, and neural networks are used for prediction.
Recommendations and Further Study: This section provides recommendations based on the analysis results and suggests areas for further research.

Short-Term Recommendations: Optimize inventory for popular meal choices to reduce waste.
Long-Term Recommendations: Implement personalized meal recommendations using collaborative filtering algorithms.
Further Study: Investigate the impact of external factors like economic indicators on customer satisfaction.
Code Implementation: The project involves actual code implementation using tools like SQL for data extraction and Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

Assumptions: The project specifies assumptions made during the analysis, such as normal distribution of variables and linear relationships.

Statistical Methods: Various statistical methods used throughout the project are outlined, including Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analyzing customer comments, and Time-Series Analysis for understanding seasonal variations.

Interpretation: The results and findings of the analysis are interpreted, and their implications are discussed.

Root Cause Analysis During Summer Months: A deeper analysis is conducted specifically for the summer months, identifying trends and potential reasons for declining F&B satisfaction scores.

Recommendations for Further Study: Additional areas for exploration and study are suggested, including temporal analysis, advanced NLP techniques, advanced statistical models, operational constraints, and more.

Overall, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing F&B service satisfaction in United Airlines, utilizing various analytical techniques and methodologies to offer actionable insights for improving customer experience and operational efficiency. The project emphasizes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and recommendations for both short-term and long-term improvements.
